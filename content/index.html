<h1>Have you met Ruby yet?</h1>

<p>Maybe you've never been exposed to programming before, but think it looks fun. Maybe you took a class or workshop, like it, but didn't know where to go from there. Maybe you're a new programmer and want to figure out which language sings to you. Then you've come to the right place.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Ruby is</strong> known as not being just another programming language, but for being a programmer's language. It's fun to learn. (I promise).</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>We are</strong> a group of Rubyists, new and experienced, from the NC's Triangle. We come from <a href="http://www.raleighrb.com">Raleigh.rb</a> and <a href="http://splatspace.org">SplatSpace</a></p></li>
</ul>
